## Robust Instance Segmentation through Reasoning about Multi-Object Occlusion

- Compositional models treat each object individually and does not exploit the mutual relationship of nearby objects
- Multi object instance segmentation, reasons about multi objects
- Occlusion reasoning model -> detects erroneous feed forward predictions and corrects them using reasoning



## How will I do it after reading the abstract and intro?
- lets say there are two objects, fg and bg where fg occluded bg. Both of them have a bbox with iou. 
- this looks like a problem of solving occluded OD and then refining to segmentation like Mask RCNN
- to segment the objects from bbox, we detect which is object, which is other object and which is context.
- when iou occurs, then we should determine which object the iou belongs to and reduce the area of segmentation for the bg object



## What's actually happening?
- its almost like what i told, you have to build on the comp model before, each forward pass detects fg, occlusion and context masks
- when there is a conflict in the pixels of the object bboxes, we compare the likelihood strengths and use that to decide which object the pixel belongs to
- (occlusion reasoning model) they use a graph order of which object is occluded by which object to refine


## After reading the paper, how can I improve it?
- 


## Some Terms that I don't know
- Amodal segmentation
